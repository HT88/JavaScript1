'use strict'

let x = 7

console.log(x = x % 3);

//It returned 1. Becuase 1 is what is left over when one operand is divided by a second operand. I guess the same applies for the rest of the examples in the bunch. 

let y = 21;

console.log(y = y % 4);

//It returned 1. 

let z = 13;
console.log(z = z % 2);

//It returned 1
